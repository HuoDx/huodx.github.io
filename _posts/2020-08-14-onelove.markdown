The OneLove Charity Music Festival is a music festival seeking to be on par with Woodstock and Live Aid.

In addition to uniting high school students with the concept of love and peace, the festival will donate all profits to the [MSF](https://msf.org/) to help contribute to the global epidemic which is raging internationally.

# 200+ people came to enjoy the performance
# 700+ people watched the live streaming online!

It was not easy to hold this festival in such a special period: but thanks to all the hard work our members have done, we eventually made it happen on August 14, 2020!

# From students, by students!

This festival is planned and organized by the **One Heart** team, which I co-founded with 5 other peers in around June 2019 with a few peers. 

*Michael, my desk neighbour, actually came up with this idea first and then asked me right away "let's do a super cool charity music festival!"*

*"I'm in," I said.*

We were known for our **restlessness** - we love music and freedom, and we call on high school students to "withdraw from contemporary life" and use music and love to wash away the dullness and numbness of life and bring love and peace.

**Fun fact: One Heart was founded on the roof of our teaching building!**

Also thanks to MUSI, a professional music studio, we are able to make this happen in the best livehouse in Beijing (and probably the best in China)!

# Support from my startup

For the fund raising platform, my startup KEEER, as a software team, provided great help. The website [onelove.keeer.net](https://onelove.keeer.net) is runned under the domain name of KEEER.

I designed and programmed all of this website, with another member Alan optimizing the code to provide a smoother experience. 

All of us were glad to use our skills to contribute to charity!

# My job: finance & accounting, tech support, live streaming

finance & accounting: I operated the donation process and keeping track of the financial statistics.

tech support: I designed and developed the online website.

live streaming: I streamed the entire performance online! (very unfortunately there is no review)

# It was like a crazy dream, but these pictures tell me it was NOT

I feel so glad to co-found such an amazing team with everybody being so supportive and productive. With out my amazing "restless" peers, I would never imagine that I could make such a music festival happen in reality!

> Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. --Tony Robbins

We donated all we have, to do - though little - all we can to help.
