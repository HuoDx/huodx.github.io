This song is made in Feburary, the most severe period when COVID-19 is raging in China. The composer hoped to use this original song to express his admiration and appreciation to the brave doctors fighting against the pandemic.

I am glad to mix and master this song - as I have the skill to do the work, I feel excited to express the same emotions through this song by contributing to it.

> There are no times of tranquility in this world, but the doctors walk in backlight.

> In backlight, for more light.
