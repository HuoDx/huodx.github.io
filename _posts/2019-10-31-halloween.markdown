The Halloween party is a huge event in our school.

Nearly a thousand of people (both teachers and students) gather at that night, wearing scary Halloween costumes and playing at the party.

Among all playable projects, the Haunted House Attraction is the most popular one: hundreds of people wanted to experience the excitement of the Haunted House set by an entire floor inside our teaching building.

So in the past, people were waiting in long lines waiting for the position. Our platform successfully solved this problem by allowing them to book and pay for the tickets before the party begins, which saves their time waiting in line at the party - they only need to go there when their round begins!
