I started to learn boxing in around November 2019 when my CAS advisor suggested me to try some sports that are more exciting and challenging.

From knowing nothing about boxing, I began my boxing journey with a tough period: For the first two class that I have taken, I found it much more challenging than I thought. In fact, it is the most challenging sport I have ever done.

Then, I continued to take the lesson once a week as usual and practiced at home as well. I learned two new moves and a combination with my physical fitness improved a lot. None of the training was easy, but eventually I got them through.

This type of training continued until COVID-19 hit my city. I was unable to take lessons anymore, so I started training at home with my dad. I really appreciate my dad for being so supportive!

*My dog was like "hmmmm... not interested" lol*

From February to September, I practiced boxing EVERY DAY to keep improving my moves and stay fit during the quarantine.
