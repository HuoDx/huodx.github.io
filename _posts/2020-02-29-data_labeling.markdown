**TL;DR: I came up with an idea to help making homeless people live better and our team proved it will work.**
# Why data labeling?

To help the homeless in Beijing sustainably, it is extremely difficult (and also unfair) to merely look for such people in society and give them money or resources: in this case, they do not produce value, but people give them resources.

Therefore, the healthiest - and therefore most sustainable - way is to allow them to produce value for society and then maximize the return of that value to them for the betterment of their lives. In other words, as long as they are producing value, the support they rely on is sustainable; they are also given the freedom to choose not to produce value.

From many interviews we have conducted, different homeless people are in different situations, some have physical disabilities that prevent them from doing heavy labor intense jobs, some have intellectual disabilities that prevent them from working in the service industry... It is hard to find a way to make them all produce value at the same time. Nevertheless, in the end, we have come to realize that their greatest value in this day and age is that **they are human beings**.

In the last 10 years, we have entered the era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as computer and the Internet technologies have grown drastically. Advances in AI technology has given computers seemingly magical powers: facial recognition, playing games, aiding in diagnosis...

However, such an ability can be hard to come by. According to the Moravec paradox, what is very instinctive for humans is indeed extremely difficult for computers. Machine learning makes it possible for a computer's knowledge not to be confined to a fixed program after the code has been written, yet the cost is real: it takes a huge set of sample to learn such a skill (suporvised learning is still a bit portion). To give a real-life example: a three-year-old child can distinguish between eyes, nose and mouth on a human face -- it is almost as simple as that; however, a computer needs to be told thousands of times by a human where the eyes are, where the nose is, where the mouth is over and over and over again - to get the hang of it. However, the thousands of (not exaggerated, even pretty conservative) training sessions required humans to provide it with a sample of what it was learning - a labeled picture of where the eyes, nose, and mouth were. Big Data now gives people enough pictures, but eventually they will need to tag them to "tell" the computer where the eyes are, where the nose is, and where the mouth is. The profession of labeling data like this is called a **data labeler**.

The value of such a profession is being a human. Although most jobs also require a certain degree of data processing ability, after research, we have found that this part of the ability can be very well solved using a computer program, the remaining core of the core, simply to play their own strengths as human beings, to do a good job of data labeling.

# The process

We act as an intermediary for task collection and distribution: we get the raw data from AI training data providers, let the homeless people complete the core data marking work in our platform, and then the platform automatically carries out simple analysis and aggregation. Then we sent the labelled data back, get the remuneration, and then we give this remuneration back to these homeless people. Since we are a public welfare organization, we can reduce the extraction of this remuneration as much as possible to ensure that a sufficient amount of remuneration is issued to the homeless people to improve their lives.

# An example (story for demonstration)

(the following characters are fictional and are used to demonstrate our model).

The vagrant Zhang San woke up in the morning from his sleep under an overpass, went to a data labeling machine we provided on the street, and started labeling data. 

He framed out some faces and circled some cars in the picture given by the machine, and at the same time made blinking eyes and open mouth movements for the machine to capture. 

Although he didn't know many words, the voice prompts inside the machine helped him understand what to do. After a few hours, he marked a lot of data. When he pressed the checkout button, the machine gave him some money. He happily took the money: now he would have money for the day's meals and still have a little money left over.

At this point, the data he has labeled has been sent to our program for further simple processing, which is then packaged and sent directly to the data company, with no additional human costs.

# Analysis

## Financial feasibility

The project is theoretically very feasible: first of all, such a machine is not too technologically advanced, and it is technically possible to modify it according to the ATM machine, considering that the cost of purchasing an ATM machine is only 1000 RMB, and the additional cost of modifying it is RMB200. Since the conversion is done by members of our charity, the labor cost is not included. The data processing server operates at $95 per month. Equipment maintenance is done by our members at no cost. The average equipment maintenance cost is conservatively estimated at $50 per month.

Can initially apply for a small loan from the bank to purchase 8 units, and then in the initial period of operation in three years to pay back about 430 yuan per month to ensure stable operation. Including data processing servers and equipment maintenance costs, the first three years must deduct 575 yuan per month, the following years only need to deduct 145 yuan per month.

Considering the current monthly income of the occupation in 3000 ~ 7000 yuan or so, we can estimate very conservatively: on the basis of the income of each 2 machines can only offset the work of a normal data marker - a monthly income of 5000 yuan, 8 machines can bring income of 40,000 yuan per month, compared to even the start-up period. The deduction is also only 1.4% of income, which has a negligible impact in terms of help for the homeless.

Due to the impact of the epidemic and time constraints, we have not been able to fully fabricate the above machine and conduct field experiments to find out how many homeless people will use the equipment every day.

But even under the most unfavorable scenario, each homeless person can earn an additional 20 yuan per day. This is double the original (average) daily income of 20 yuan. Thus, the program is effective in helping the homeless problem.

## AI training data provider

Due to the outbreak, we have not yet been able to complete all negotiations with the data company concerned. However, since the proposal completely simulates real employees and even eliminates the additional expenses that may be incurred in hiring employees, from the company's standpoint of minimizing costs, the data company should have no reason to refuse. In addition, the cooperation also allows the data company to increase the humanistic image of "helping the homeless", which helps the company's public relations.

## Homeless people

Based on field interviews and experiments with the demo program, we found that homeless people have the ability to do AI data tagging as expected.
